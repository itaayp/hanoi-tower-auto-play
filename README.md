# hanoi-tower-auto-play
Hanoi Tower Auto-play was builded based on C language, "threaded list" concept and recursive functions. The project's goal is that the computer, based on concepts of recursive functions, find the challenge's solution. Also, different from the traditional Hanoi Tower, this game uses 4 towers and 8 disks.
